This is modified StreamControl from https://farpnut.net/streamcontrol/ for me & my circle to use 

Rough how-to:
1. Place StreamControl.exe in it's own directory (shouldn't actually matter where)
2. Run it. It should autodetect your XSplit installation if you installed XSplit to the default location. If not, please click configure and set it there.
3. Load XSplit and set up the scene. Add the SWF overlays you require.
4. Done.
